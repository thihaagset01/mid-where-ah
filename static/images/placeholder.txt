This directory will contain the following image files:
- favicon.ico
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png

You'll need to create these image files with appropriate Singapore-themed branding for your MidWhereAh app.

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images or create simple icons with tools like:
1. Figma
2. Canva
3. Adobe Illustrator
4. Online favicon generators

The icons should follow your app's color scheme (blue primary color #4285F4) and include a map pin or location marker as part of the design.
